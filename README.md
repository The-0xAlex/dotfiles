# 0xAlex Dotfiles

Contains configuration and installation for most of my dev tools.

I spend most of my time in MacOS.  The install script should handle most of
what you need, or at least give you some easily solvable errors.

Most of my remote environments run some flavor of Ubuntu.  As such, the
install script and deps are mostly portable and there's a top-level check for
platform dependant behaviors included.

### Installation

If you want to replicate my env, the steps are pretty easy.

1. Clone this repo

```bash
    git clone https://www.github.com/The-0xAlex/dotfiles.git
```

2. Run install.sh
